summary: 'A quantitative trading system combining FinBERT sentiment analysis with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to capture alpha in volatile markets.'

## Project Overview

**Vibe Trading** is an experimental quantitative trading system designed to quantify "market sentiment" (the "Vibe") and fuse it with traditional momentum indicators.

The core hypothesis is that in high-volatility regimes, social sentiment leads price action. By using Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze news and social signals, we can adjust the risk exposure of our RL agents dynamically.

## Tech Stack

* **Core Logic**: Python, Backtrader
* **AI Models**: FinBERT (Sentiment), PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
* **Infrastructure**: Docker, TimescaleDB
* **Optimization**: X-of-Thought Prompting for signal filtering

## Methodology

### 1. Sentiment Extraction
We scrape data from major financial news outlets and use **FinBERT** to classify headlines into `Positive`, `Negative`, or `Neutral`.

### 2. Signal Fusion
Instead of using sentiment as a direct trigger, we use it as a **state feature** in our DRL environment (OpenAI Gym interface). The agent learns to:
- Increase position size when Sentiment > Threshold AND Momentum is Up.
- Cut losses faster when Sentiment turns Negative.

## Preliminary Results

* **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.1 (Backtest 2023-2025)
* **Max Drawdown**: -12%
